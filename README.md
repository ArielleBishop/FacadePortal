### Austauschstadt (Exchange City)

**Arielle Bishop, Kriti Gurubacharya, Maggie Van Nortwick**

This work was inspired by the emerging technologies of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Our piece operates at the intersection of traditional sculpture and these new mediums by both occupying a space and transforming it. In an effort to spark a dialogue on globalization, the Ars Electronica Centerâ€™s facade serves as a portal between communities, dropping a cubic piece of space from another city into the heart of Linz. Through this, an observer can connect to the current experience of another human being in that very moment, yet in a completely different geographical and sociopolitical circumstance.

The creators are 3 students from Northeastern University, located in Boston, Massachusetts. We are all thrilled to have had the opportunity to spend some time in Linz and create a piece of art for this community.

Must obtain an API key from https://openweathermap.org/api for "current weather data" loaded as a system environment variable named "OPEN_WEATHER_MAP" in order to run.
