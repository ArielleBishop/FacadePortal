// TODO:

// light, regular, and heavy levels for weather
// slow down text scroll speed
// make only 1 space between letters rather than 2
// remove time/status/temperature from the text - the inspiration is that the location is what matters
//     and the actual "weather" aspect shouldn't be the focus, or should be implicit
// make all "sky" blues a bit darker & more green-blue (less purple)
// reduce velocity on rain/snow
// reduce density of clouds
// increase opacity on wind
// stars read as snow- maybe we can make their brightness "twinkle" over time?
// up contrast basically everywhere
// extend time window to indicate sunset/sunrise
