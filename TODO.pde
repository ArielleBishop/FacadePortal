// TODO:


// higher contrast in mist
// brighter sand - brighter yellow
// black text over all atmospheric conditions

// light, regular, and heavy levels for weather
// make text just the city name in German
// stars read as snow- maybe we can make their brightness "twinkle" over time?
// up contrast basically everywhere
// extend time window to indicate sunset/sunrise
// reduce radius of cloud
// make sure all atmospheric effects will be high enough contrast with black text/day background or white text/night background
// make cloud color always white and towards the top of the screen
// add cloud effects to thunderstorm/rain/drizzle etc.
// make wind speed across the screen proportional to actual wind speed
