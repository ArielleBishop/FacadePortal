// TODO:

// higher contrast in mist
// brighter sand - brighter yellow
// black text over all atmospheric conditions
// make sure all atmospheric effects will be high enough contrast with black text/day background or white text/night background
// light, regular, and heavy levels for weather
// remove temperature from the text - the inspiration is that the location is what matters
//     and the actual "weather" aspect shouldn't be the focus, or should be implicit
// up contrast basically everywhere// add cloud effects to thunderstorm/rain/drizzle etc.
// make wind speed across the screen proportional to actual wind speed
