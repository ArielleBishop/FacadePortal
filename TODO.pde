// TODO:


// higher contrast in mist
// brighter sand - brighter yellow
// black text over all atmospheric conditions

// light, regular, and heavy levels for weather
// remove temperature from the text - the inspiration is that the location is what matters
//     and the actual "weather" aspect shouldn't be the focus, or should be implicit
// make all "sky" blues a bit darker & more green-blue (less purple)
// reduce velocity on rain/snow
// stars read as snow- maybe we can make their brightness "twinkle" over time?
// up contrast basically everywhere
// make sure all atmospheric effects will be high enough contrast with black text/day background or white text/night background
// make cloud color always white and towards the top of the screen
// add cloud effects to thunderstorm/rain/drizzle etc.
